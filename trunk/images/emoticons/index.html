Skills
I started to use computer at school in year 10 (in 1993). At that time, most of the PCs are 386 with 66MHz and black-and-white monitor. 486DX and colour monitor is the luxury one on earth. I learnt the basic computer skills and programming with Pascal and algorithm. I was the naughtiest student in the class who guessed out the administrator's password from my teacher and messed up all the installed software. But after all, I knew what I had done and I was able to fix most of them.

For the next two years, I had not any subject related to computer and I had no chance to walk into the computer lab. I had to save my pocket money and hired computers for exercises and experiments. I read a lot of computer books, tips and tricks and I tried all of the examples I had found on the hired computers. Honestly, some people did not really want me to use their computers.

I went to university in 1996 and owned my first PC a year later. It was an AMD K5 (586) 166MHz and 1.0 GB storage capacity. From that moment, my home likes heaven and it was the time I would never forget.

Years by years, I had learned and done several useful programs for myself and friends in Pascal (text-based and graphic), FoxPro and Visual Basic. I could not keep them all because some of my hard drives died.

Microsoft Windows 
Linux (RedHat, Mandrake, Suse)

News and update 

10th November, 2004: Firefox phenomenon
I have heard people talking about firefox, a new internet browser. Eight millions people have downloaded and tried. I was just being curious. After using it for reading news for 5 minutes, I decided to uninstall it. It is a little bit better than Microsoft Internet Explorer but not as convenient and friendly as Maxthon. Try and see!!!

06th May, 2004: New Search tool!
Internal search allows people search through my website. This is quite useful when people can not locate the information they want to find. Search engine will return the list of pages based on keywords. This tools is also written only by JavaScript. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
04th May, 2004: New Calendar!
Calendar is really vital to keep track of daily activities or appointments. This website is hosted with free hosting service which support only html and client-side scripting languages. It is so difficult to make a dynamic website on that server. However, with a little skill of using JavaScript, a little utility like Calendar can be set up and run well. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20th April, 2004: New face!
Feedbacks of my friends and visitors made me change my mind. The website colour scheme need to be changed, to be brighter (brighter future, maybe). The other reason is that it will be my assignment for Principles of Design subject. So far, I have had good advice and compliments from my friends and classmates. Thanks for your comments. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14th February, 2004: Site map!
There are some topics in my website which may confuse its audience. Site map should be an useful tool giving them an overview of the website. 
Home - the main page of the site 
About - all information about me 
Calendar - my schedules 
Links - frequent and useful website addresses 
Gallery - my photo album about everything: myself, family, friends and nature 
Portfolio - my own programs and class works 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
27th January, 2004: Website is up!
I have been thinking about setting up a home page for a long time. My first website was online in 2000 at www.md-group.net. During that time, the site helps us (my friends and I) doing our business. Since 2003, we'd lost our passion and had no where to go. As a result, the website has gone following by the end of our business. This site is now being hosted by a free and reliable hosting service (http://au.geocities.yahoo.com).
